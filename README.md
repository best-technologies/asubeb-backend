GET /admin/dashboard?session=2024/2025&term=SECOND_TERM
```
Returns comprehensive dashboard data including:
- Total students, schools, classes
- Gender distribution statistics
- Top 10 performing students with school and class information
- Performance analytics

### Student Management
```
GET    /admin/students              # Get all students
GET    /admin/students/:id          # Get student by ID
POST   /admin/students              # Create new student
PUT    /admin/students/:id          # Update student
DELETE /admin/students/:id          # Delete student
GET    /admin/students/:id/assessment-breakdown  # Get student assessments
GET    /admin/students/explorer     # Cascading explorer (sessions/terms → LGAs → schools → classes → students)
GET    /admin/students/explore      # Alias of explorer
```

#### Students Explorer
Endpoint to progressively fetch filters and results for the Students tab.

Query parameters (all optional):
- `sessionId`: selected session id
- `termId`: selected term id
- `lgaId`: selected LGA id
- `schoolId`: selected school id
- `classId`: selected class id
- `studentId`: selected student id (returns that student for current active session/term)
- `search`: search string (student name, school name, or LGA name)
- `page`: students page number (default 1)
- `limit`: students per page (default 10)

Behavior:
- No params: returns all active sessions (with terms) and all LGAs
- With `lgaId`: also returns schools under that LGA
- With `schoolId`: returns all active classes (classes are global, not per-school)
- With `classId` (optionally with `schoolId`): returns students in that class, filtered by school if provided, for the active session/term; includes pagination
- With `studentId`: returns that student’s record and assessments for the active session/term
- `search` works globally or scoped (by `lgaId`/`schoolId`/`classId`) and is applied to student first/last name, school name, or LGA name
